    "The exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset shows that survival was strongly influenced by gender, passenger class, and fare. Females and first-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates. Fare showed a positive correlation with survival, while age had a moderate effect. Missing values were observed mainly in the Age and Cabin columns.\n"
